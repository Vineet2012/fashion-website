      "Based on other reviews I bought the Large. The suit fit, but you could not bend knees or elbows. It looks very stylish with the slim cut but you could only stand for a picture and not walk/dance/sit in comfort. It's too tight to sit or do any activity in if you need to bend or knees and arms such as walking around lots. I mean you still could but you wont be comfortable at all. The pants came to ankle & it had a 1in hem that you could take down if necessary I guess. I really don't understand how some reviews had a guy over 6'1 and over 200lbs fit this suit. There's no way. If you are over 6' all and over 175lbs, go for the XL minimum. I have reordered the XXL because the purple was out of the XL. I'll give an update on fit once I get the XXL. All pockets are fake except the on inside jacket pocket. Purple Color is exactly as shown in their picture.",
      "Great quality, was pleasantly surprised. Fit almost perfectly, just a little long in the pant legs and arm sleeves and a few buttons are a little loose but that can be taken up and fixed. Highly recommended for a budget suit.",

If you are over 6' all and over 175lbs, go for the XL minimum. I have reordered the XXL because the purple was out of the XL. I'll give an update on fit once I get the XXL. All pockets are fake except the on inside jacket pocket. Purple Color is exactly as shown in their picture.",

      "Based on other reviews I bought the Large. The suit fit, but you could not bend knees or elbows. It looks very stylish with the slim cut but you could only stand for a picture and not walk/dance/sit in comfort. It's too tight to sit or do any activity in if you need to bend or knees and arms such as walking around lots. I mean you still could but you wont be comfortable at all. The pants came to ankle & it had a 1in hem that you could take down if necessary I guess. I really don't understand how some reviews had a guy over 6'1 and over 200lbs fit this suit. There's no way. If you are over 6' all and over 175lbs, go for the XL minimum. I have reordered the XXL because the purple was out of the XL. I'll give an update on fit once I get the XXL. All pockets are fake except the on inside jacket pocket. Purple Color is exactly as shown in their picture.",
